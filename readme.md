#### **New Jersey Superfund Sites**
##### Final Web Mapping Project

###### Abbey Rankins

This project ! worked on creating a bivariate web map that presents data in both point and polygon forms. I sourced superfund site information from the Environmental Protection Agency and County-level income data from the 2010 United States Census via census.gov. The aim of my map was to explore potential economic disparities tied to superfund site distribution and severity. To achieve this, I meticulously categorized the data points based on site scores. Low scores are those from 20 - 40, Moderate scores from 40 - 60, and High scores above 60.
